# Smart Agriculture System Proposal

**Objective**: Develop a smart farming system that leverages AI and IoT to enhance crop yield prediction, water usage, and resource planning.

## Required Sensors:
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- Temperature Sensor
- Humidity Sensor
- Light Intensity Sensor (LDR)
- pH Sensor

## Proposed AI Model:
A Random Forest Regression model is proposed to predict crop yield based on multi-sensor input data. The model is trained using historical data and sensor readings.

## Data Flow Summary:
1. Sensors collect real-time environmental data.
2. Microcontroller (Arduino) aggregates sensor signals.
3. Edge device (Raspberry Pi) processes and forwards to cloud AI model.
4. AI model predicts optimal watering schedules and crop yield.
5. Dashboard presents actionable insights to farmers.

## Benefits:
- Optimizes water and fertilizer usage.
- Improves yield forecasting.
- Enables remote monitoring via dashboard.
