# AI in Smart Cities: Case Study Critique

## Integration of AI with IoT for Urban Sustainability

AI-IoT systems enable real-time traffic monitoring and adaptive signal control, reducing congestion and emissions. They also support predictive maintenance of infrastructure, optimizing resource usage and public safety.

## Challenges Identified:
1. **Data Security**: Real-time data from vehicles and infrastructure is sensitive. Unauthorized access can compromise safety.
2. **Infrastructure Cost**: Deploying and maintaining IoT infrastructure at city scale is expensive and requires ongoing updates.
