# Quantum AI Simulation

We use IBM Quantum Experience to build a 2-qubit entangled circuit. This simulates parallel evaluation of states, aiding tasks like drug discovery where multiple molecular structures are explored.

Quantum optimization algorithms like QAOA help reduce the time for complex AI decisions.
