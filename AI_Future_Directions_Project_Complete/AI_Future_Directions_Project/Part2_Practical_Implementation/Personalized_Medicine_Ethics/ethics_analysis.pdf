# Ethics Analysis in Personalized Medicine

AI algorithms trained on genomic datasets like TCGA may underrepresent certain ethnic groups, leading to biased treatment recommendations. This risks unequal healthcare outcomes.

## Strategies for Fairness:
- Curate diverse datasets including underrepresented groups.
- Implement bias detection and mitigation techniques during model training.
- Promote transparency in AI decision-making processes.

These practices ensure AI applications in medicine are equitable, effective, and inclusive.
